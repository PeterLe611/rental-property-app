# rental-property-app

## A system to manage and track rental properties, tenants, and agreements. This is a basic console application project before it is developed into a full-fledged application with UI, GUI, etc.

This is my first individual project for my 'Further Programming' course (COSC2440|COSC2731) at RMIT University. The project is built with the implementations of the following aspects of programming: 

* Demonstrate a working knowledge of OO concepts and design principles in the analysis, design, and implementation of solutions for small to medium-scale problems. 
* Describe and document diagrammatically the OO design of the Java Collections Framework (JCF) and apply this framework to Java code. 
* Demonstrate Proficiency using an integrated development environment such as Eclipse for project management, coding, and debugging.
